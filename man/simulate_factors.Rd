\arguments{
\item{factors}{Numeric (length = 1).
Number of factors}

\item{variables}{Numeric (length = 1 or factors).
Number of variables per factor.
Can be a single value or as many values as there are factors.
Minimum three variables per factor}

\item{variables_range}{Numeric (length = 2).
Range of variables to randomly select from a random uniform distribution.
Minimum three variables per factor}

\item{loadings}{Numeric or matrix (length = 1, factors, or factors * (factors \* variables)).
Loadings drawn from a random uniform distribution using +/- 0.10 of value input.
Can be a single value or as many values as there are factors (corresponding to the factors).
Can also be a loading matrix. Columns must match factors and rows must match total variables (factors * variables)}

\item{loadings_range}{Numeric (length = 2).
Range of loadings to randomly select from a random uniform distribution}

\item{cross_loadings}{Numeric or matrix (length = 1, factors, or factors * (factors \* variables)).
Cross-loadings drawn from a random normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of value input.
Can be a single value or as many values as there are factors (corresponding to the factors).
Can also be a loading matrix. Columns must match factors and rows must match total variables (factors * variables)}

\item{cross_loadings_range}{Numeric (length = 2).
Range of cross-loadings to randomly select from a random uniform distribution}

\item{correlations}{Numeric (length = 1 or factors * factors).
Can be a single value that will be used for all correlations between factors.
Can also be a square matrix (factors * factors)}

\item{correlations_range}{Numeric (length = 2).
Range of correlations to randomly select from a random uniform distribution}

\item{sample_size}{Numeric (length = 1).
Number of cases to generate from a random multivariate normal distribution using
\code{\link[mvtnorm]{rmvnorm}}}

\item{variable_categories}{Numeric (length = 1 or total variables (factors * variables)).
Number of categories for each variable. \code{Inf} is used for continuous variables; otherwise,
values reflect number of categories}

\item{categorical_limit}{Numeric (length = 1).
Values greater than input value are considered continuous.
Defaults to \code{5} meaning that 6 or more categories are considered continuous
(i.e., variables are \emph{not} categorized from continuous to categorical)}

\item{skew}{Numeric (length = 1 or categorical variables).
Skew to be included in categorical variables. It is randomly sampled from provided values.
Can be a single value or as many values as there are (total) variables.
Current skew implementation is between -2 and 2 in increments of 0.50.
Skews that are not in this sequence will be converted to their nearest
value in the sequence. Not recommended to use with \code{variables_range}.
Future versions will incorporate finer skews}

\item{skew_range}{Numeric (length = 2).
Randomly selects skews within in the range.
Somewhat redundant with \code{skew} but more flexible.
Compatible with \code{variables_range}}
}
\value{

Simulates data from a latent factor model based on many
manipulable parameters. Parameters do not have default values and
must each be set. See examples to get started
